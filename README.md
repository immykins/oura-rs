oura-rs
==

Rust wrapper for the Oura API.

Oura has a REST API for accessing your biometrics data (readiness, sleep, activity levels, bedtime).

The API uses OAuth2 authentication. This library does not include an Oauth2 intregration, and expects to be given a personal access token.

### Getting Started

Create an Oura account (if you haven't) and use that to create a personal access token. See oura docs:  https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/.
