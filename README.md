oura-rs
==

Rust wrapper for the Oura API.

Oura has a REST API for accessing your biometrics data (readiness, sleep, activity levels, bedtime).

It uses OAuth2 authentication. This library does not include that functionality, and expects you to provide it with a valid OAuth2 token.

### Getting Started

You need an our account, personal access token, and an API application. See this doc: https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/
