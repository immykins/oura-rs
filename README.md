oura-rs
==

Rust wrapper and CLI for the Oura API.

Oura has a REST API for accessing your biometrics data (readiness, sleep, activity levels, bedtime).

The API uses OAuth2 authentication. This library does not include an OAuth2 intregration, and expects to be given a personal access token.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/immykins/oura-rs.git
cd oura-rs
cargo build
```

(add AUR installation and crates.io)

### Getting Started

Create an Oura account (if you haven't) and use that to create a personal access token. See oura docs:  https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/.

(insert more details + library examples here)

### CLI shenanigans

°˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°

### Using in an existing project

Import the client and use it (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ

### Contributing

This is designed in a modular fashion, so you can easily contribute a plugin (*≧ω≦*)

### Roadmap

- [ ] API wrapper
- [ ] CLI
- DB integrations:
  - [ ] Prometheus

I might split out the CLI idk (￣︿￣)
